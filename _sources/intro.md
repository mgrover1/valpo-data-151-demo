# Overview

Provided within this JupyterBook are a few examples of data produced/visualized as part of the Earth System Data Science Initiative at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

## Presentation Slides
If you are interested in accessing the slides from the presentation, you can find them using [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n9V17U5Oo7-ZreuxNjzPjLG9O9V9_fKsacM6v1M-fCY/edit?usp=sharing)

## Demos
The example notebooks, accessible via the navigation bar on the left, were run on NCAR High Peformance Computer (HPC) resources, but it possible to run them yourself too! Be sure to change the `Dask` cluster to `LocalCluster` before executing all of the cells. If you are new to Python, be sure to check out the foundational Python for the Geosciences material at the [Project Pythia Portal](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)!
